                <p class="abouttext">The Chicago Address Conversion Guide is an ongoing project to help make finding the old address of a property in Chicago much simpler. In 1909, the city changed every address and re-organized it based off a 0 N, 0 S, 0 E, 0 W starting point at the corner of State and Madison streets downtown./
                Prior to this, every address in the city was unorganized and in non-numerical order. To find the old address of a current property in Chicago usually takes digging through old books. This site was developed to create an easy way to start your search for an old address and was built/
                based off the 1909 Address Guide printed at the time of the address conversion.
                While there's a lot of data, it's not comprehensive--not every address around back then still exists today and vice versa. While you might search for an address here, you might not find its match, but there are other resources you can check as well. For any serious/
                research, it is recommended to still double check with the original address conversion books. This site is a guide to find the address you need, but all data entry has been done by humans.</p>
